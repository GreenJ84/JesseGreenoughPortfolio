          Hi, I&apos;m Jesse ‚Äî a Texas-born Eagle Scout thriving in the natural beauty of Washington State. 
          My passion for programming began years ago, driven by a relentless curiosity to learn and create. 
          In 2022, I turned this passion into a career path by attending the <span className="detail_plus"> Coding Dojo </span> Web Development Bootcamp, transforming my side work into a full-time pursuit.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am passionate about coding because it enables me to leverage
          technology to create innovative web technologies and products that
          have a positive
          <span className="detail_plus"> impact on society. </span>
          My mission is to harness the power of technology to drive meaningful impact and create value for users and businesses alike.
          <br />
          <br />
          With fluency in
          <span className="detail_plus"> TypeScript </span> and
          <span className="detail_plus"> JavaScript </span>
          (including <span className="detail_plus"> Node.js </span>) and significant experience in <span className="detail_plus"> Java </span>,
          <span className="detail_plus"> Python </span>
          (with Typings), and
          <span className="detail_plus"> Rust </span>
          , I specialize in building innovative software technologies and products that solve real-world problems.
