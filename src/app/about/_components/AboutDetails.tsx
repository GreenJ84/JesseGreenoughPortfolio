        Return to <span className="detail">Education</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In 2024, I proudly earned my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Western Governors University (WGU), a milestone that marked the culmination of dedication, perseverance, and passion for the field. My undergraduate journey provided me with a solid foundation in software development, equipping me with both the theoretical knowledge and practical skills to thrive in the dynamic world of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing the importance of continuous growth in an industry that never stands still, I decided to return to WGU the following year to pursue a Master of Science in Cybersecurity. This decision reflects my commitment to expanding my expertise into the critical realm of protecting digital systems and safeguarding information in an increasingly interconnected world. By building upon my software engineering background with advanced studies in cybersecurity, I aim to become a well-rounded professional capable of addressing complex challenges and driving innovation in both fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, I am driven by a relentless desire to learn and evolve, ensuring that I stay at the forefront of the ever-changing landscape of technology. Whether it&apos;s mastering the latest programming techniques or tackling cutting-edge security issues, I am passionate about pushing boundaries and making a meaningful impact in the tech community.

        <span className="detail">Coding</span> Bootcamp
      </h2>
      <p>
        While balancing work and life, I continued to expand my coding knowledge
        during my free time, embracing coding tutorials, online resources, and
        personal projects which allowed me to explore different languages and
        frameworks, fueling my passion for problem-solving and innovation. Then
        in 2022, I received the opportunity to attend the Coding Dojo full stack
        web development bootcamp. Within the bootcamp I further honed my skills
        and acquired the necessary expertise to become a versatile full-stack
        software developer.
        Even after the camp I dedicated my free time to continuous learning,
        actively engaging in coding challenges, collaborating on real-world projects,
        and planning for return to formal education.

        Start of a <span className="detail">Family</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was during my time as a Fred Meyer Department manager that I met an incredible woman and with her, an amazing daughter. With time I was able to leech onto those two and become a proud husband and even prouder father. Not soon after, my wife and I had a handsome son come into this world as well. My children inspire me to be the best version of myself and motivate me to create a brighter future.

        Early <span className="detail">Career</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        After re-establishing myself upon leaving college, I entered the workforce. Embracing a structured
        environment, I tapped into my strong work ethic and adaptability to
        thrive in various roles. This allowed me to progress from entry-level
        positions to leadership roles such as Store Apprentice at Chipotle and
        Department Manager at Fred Meyer, where I honed my managerial skills,
        fostered positive team cultures, and contributed to the customer experience of the
        service industry for over 8 years.

      <h2>
        <span className="detail">College</span> Transition
      </h2>
      <p>
        Transitioning to college at the University of Washington Seattle campus
        was one of the biggest challenges of my life as I adapted to a new
        environment across the country away from the only home I had known. In
        my second semester, my father&apos;s deteriorating mental health
        unveiled dark truths about my immediate family, which drastically
        altered my perception of reality, affected my own mental well-being, and
        distorted my view of the people I knew and the events of my childhood.
        This was a profound personal challenge that tested my resilience and
        forced me to reevaluate my priorities. As a result, I chose to withdraw
        from college to navigate my own mental health crisis, taking a
        courageous step towards prioritizing self-care and seeking the support I
        needed.

        Early <span className="detail">Education</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I had the opportunity to attend a specialized dual credit early college high school that was relatively new within my hometown. It was this school that allowed me, with my determination and effort, to earn my Associates degree in my junior year of high school, a year earlier than the program (1 of 3 students to accomplish that feat within my graduating class).
      </p>
      <p style={{"marginTop": "8dvh"}}>
        I was able to attend the University of Texas - El Paso during my senior year and upon graduating I had attained distinguished achievement and honors. It was during this period time that I discovered my passion for coding through the robotics, which sparked my interest in the world of programming and ignited my curiosity to explore the endless possibilities of software development.

        My <span className="detail">Childhood</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in
        <span className="detail"> El Paso, Texas</span>, a border city known for
        its unique cultural blend. Ever since I was young, I was driven to
        achieve personal growth and make the most of my potential. I actively
        participated in community sports, educational clubs (math club, debate
        team, etc), and the Boy Scouts of America. These activities instilled in
        me important values of leadership, resilience, and community service. Of
        which is also where my fascination with nature and my love of math began.
