        {" "}
        I was born and raised in
        <span className="detail"> El Paso, Texas, </span>a border city known for
        its unique cultural blend. Ever since I was young, I was driven to
        achieve personal growth and make the most of my potential. I actively
        participated in community sports, educational clubs (math club, debate
        team, etc), and the Boy Scouts of America. These activities instilled in
        me important values of leadership, resilience, and community service. Of
        which is also where my fascination with nature (GREEN-ery =&gt;
        GREEN-ough ðŸ¤£) and my love of math began.

      <p>
        {" "}
        In high school, I attended a specialized Running Start program where
        through my determination and effort I attained distinguished
        achievements and earned my Associates degree in my junior year of high
        school, a year earlier than the program (1 of 3 students to accomplish
        that feat for the city of El Paso that year). It was during this time
        that I discovered my passion for coding through the robotics club, which
        sparked my interest in the world of programming and ignited my curiosity
        to explore the endless possibilities of software development.

        {" "}
        Transitioning to college at the University of Washington Seattle campus
        was one of the biggest challenges of my life as I adapted to a new
        environment across the country away from the only home I had known. In
        my second semester, my father&apos;s deteriorating mental health
        unveiled dark truths about my immediate family, which drastically
        altered my perception of reality, affected my own mental well-being, and
        distorted my view of the people I knew and the events of my childhood.
        This was a profound personal challenge that tested my resilience and
        forced me to reevaluate my priorities. As a result, I had to withdraw
        from college to navigate my own mental health crisis, taking a
        courageous step towards prioritizing self-care and seeking the support I
        needed.

      <p>
        {" "}
        From there I re-established myself and entered the workforce as my only
        foreseeable means to pay off accumulated debts. Embracing a structured
        environment, I tapped into my strong work ethic and adaptability to
        thrive in various roles. This allowed me to progress from entry-level
        positions to leadership roles such as Store Apprentice at Chipotle and
        Department Manager at Fred Meyer, where I honed my managerial skills,
        fostered a positive team culture, and contributed to the growth of the
        organization(s) for over 8 years. It was during my time as a Fred Meyer Department manager that I met
        my incredible fiancÃ© and became a proud father to a beautiful daughter and handsome son
        who inspire me to be the best version of myself and motivate me to
        create a brighter future.

        {" "}
        While balancing work and life, I continued to expand my coding knowledge
        during my free time, embracing coding tutorials, online resources, and
        personal projects which allowed me to explore different languages and
        frameworks, fueling my passion for problem-solving and innovation. Then
        in 2022, I received the opportunity to attend the Coding Dojo full stack
        web development bootcamp. Within the bootcamp I further honed my skills
        and acquired the necessary expertise to become a versatile full-stack
        software developer and ever since I knew this was the career field I wanted to be a part of.
        I had then dedicated my free time to continuous learning,
        actively engaging in coding challenges, collaborating on real-world projects,
        and planning for return to formal education.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Western Governors University,
        and I plan to return in the future for my Masters degree. Above all else, I will always strive to
        enhance my abilities in the ever-evolving field of software development.

        Through my journey, I have experienced personal and professional growth,
        and I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for coding to
        contribute to the dynamic world of software development. With a firm
        belief in the power of technology to drive positive change, I am excited
        to be part of innovative projects that shape the future and make a
        meaningful impact in the lives of others.
