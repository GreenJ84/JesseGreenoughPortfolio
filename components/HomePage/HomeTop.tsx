        <p>
          I am Jesse, a Texas born Eagle Scout living in the naturally
          beautiful, Washington State. I fell in love with programming years ago
          and have constantly pushed learning more and more at every
          opportunity! In 2022, one such significant opportunity that I recieved
          was the ability to attend the
          <span className="detail_plus"> Coding Dojo </span>
          Web Development bootcamp and change my side work into a full-time
          career pursuit.
          <br />
          <br />I am passionate about coding because it enables me to leverage
          technology to create innovative web technologies and products that
          have a positive
          <span className="detail_plus"> impact on society. </span>
          As for tech languages, I am fluent in
          <span className="detail_plus"> TypeScript </span>
          and
          <span className="detail_plus"> JavaScript </span>
          with
          <span className="detail_plus"> Node.js </span>
          and I have a significant knowledge of
          <span className="detail_plus"> Python </span>
          (with Typings),
          <span className="detail_plus"> Rust </span>, and
          <span className="detail_plus"> Java.</span>
        </p>
