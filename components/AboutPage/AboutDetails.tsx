        {" "}
        I was born and raise in the border city of{" "}
        <span className="detail">El Paso, Texas.</span> Ever since I was young,
        I strove to make the most of myself. I participated in community
        sports, educational clubs (math club, debate team, etc), and the Boy Scouts of America.
        These kept me active and spending a lot of my time either outdoors or
        solving equations, which is where my fascination with nature (GREEN-ery
        =&gt; GREEN-ough ðŸ¤£) and my love of math began. Both are big parts of my
        identity to this day.
      </p>
      <p className={css.aboutMe}>
        {" "}
        I attended a Running Start focused high school where, through my determination
        and effort, attained distinguished achievements and was able to receive my Associates degree
        my junior year of high school, a year earlier than the program. 1 of 3 students to accomplish that feat
        for the city of El Paso that year. Also,  this is where I was introduced to
        coding in robotics club and started using it as a hobby in my life.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className={css.aboutMe}>
        {" "}
        College afterwards ended up being one of the hardest times of my life. I
        traveled across the states to attend college at the University of
        Washington in Seattle, WA. In my second semester of college my
        father&apos;s mental health deteriorated which inevitably caused him to
        reveal dark truths about my immediate family, some of which altered my
        entire reality around the people I knew and the events of my childhood, which
        led to a very unstable environment for me mentally and concluded with my
        withdrawal as I faced my own mental health crisis.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className={css.aboutMe}>
        {" "}
        From there I re-established myself and entered the workforce as my only forseeable option to start
        earning towards paying off accumulated debt. In the workplace I started to excel because
        I was able to utilize my work ethic and abilities within a structured environment. It facilitated
        my ability to attain achievement and experience, allowing me to move up
        from starting positions to lead positions at every job I had. Even
        taking over manager positions at multiple locations. It was in the
        customer service industry, specifially working at Fred Meyer, that led me
        to me my amazing fiancÃ© and the blessing of a
        beautiful daughter that has become the love of my life.

        While life went on I had kept learning bits and pieces of code here and
        there. Within the last 3 years I started helping out others with my
        skill and tried expanding my knowledge with the free time that I had. In 2022, I recieved the
        opportunity to attend the Coding Dojo full stack web development bootcamp. Within the bootcamp I was able significantly increase
        my knowledge by learning the skills necessary to
        become a Full-stack Software Developer across multiple stacks. Ever since I have continuously
        been increasing my knowledge though online course consumption, building and deploying
        applications, and continual algorithm practice.
